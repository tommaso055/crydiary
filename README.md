This is a collection of Scaffold-ETH challenges aimed at teaching the basics of the following concepts:

- Solidity
- Hardhat (deploy and test)
- NextJS
- Scaffold-ETH (yarn, hooks, components, etc)
- Protocol Integrations (subgraph-package, etc)

</h4>

🧪 An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.

⚙️ Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, and Typescript.

- ✅ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- 🔥 **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- 🔐 **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.
